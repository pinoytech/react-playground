## React Projects

This is a big dump of code mostly in react, react-dom. I push a lot of things I play around when working with react.

* HelloReact - a simple form application
* HelloReactWebPack - a simple form application using Webpack and Babel
* ReactBoilerplate - a very simple boilerplate for ES6, react, react-dom, using babela and webpack
* step-redux-youtube-player - React-Redux Youtube Player for Searching Using Redux, Promise and Axios
* gravatar - a very simple app that shows a gravatar image depending on the email you typed
